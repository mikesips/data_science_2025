This repository uses **Python 3** and common scientific computing libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. We recommend using **Miniconda** to manage environments and dependencies.


- **Option 1**: Conda environment (`miniconda`)
- **Option 2**: Python virtual environment (`venv`)

See instructions for mini-conda environment [here](./setup/local-install-instructions_mini_conda.md)
